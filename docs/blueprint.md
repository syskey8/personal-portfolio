- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for both headlines and body, ensuring legibility and a modern feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clean, minimalist icons with rounded corners, in line with Apple's design aesthetics.

- Use subtle, smooth animations (like Apple's) for transitions, hover effects, and the typing indicator in the chat interface.
